      When someone sends you a draft of their work, whether that's a technical writeup, a recipe for the best goddamn brownies you've ever tasted, a heartfelt and heartbreaking poem, or a fanfic of your favorite slash, they're trusting you to treat that work with love and respect. Unfortunately, modern software has made it harder and harder for us to uphold the trust, love, and respect with which people share their words with us. AI assistants and "copilots" can abuse that trust to train on and plagarize work, can suggest crude and inhuman edits, and can grant copyright permissions to giant corporations that fail to uphold that trust.

AI chatbots do not and cannot care, and truth is simply not a goal that they are designed to achieve.

    <h1>What is AI? What are copilots? Why should you care?</h1>
    <p>
      You've probably seen the term <em>artifical intelligence</em>, or AI for short, a lot lately. It's become the latest tech buzzword, completely eclipsing the hype of every other buzzword in recent memory. Every product, service, and device seems to advertise AI features, so it's a bit confusing trying to figure out what AI even is. Unfortunately, this page won't be able to help a lot there &mdash; the term is intentionally confusing, and as a marketing decision. For decades, "AI" has referred to different fields of research within computer science (often related to machine learning), or alternatively, to the kinds of techniques used to make convincing characters in video games.
    </p>

    <p>
      As of late, however, the term AI gets much more commonly used to refer either to <abbr title="large language models">LLMs</abbr> like ChatGPT, which generate plausible sounding text, or to <abbr title="generative adversarial networks">GANs</abbr> like Midjourney, which are most often used to generate plausible looking images. Increasingly, LLMs are included as features in modern software, presented as "chatbots," "assistants," or "copilots." They may appear as more sophisticated autocompletes, adding in more text that sounds vaugely like the text you've already written, or may be presented as tools for performing research, and even generating whole documents automatically.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Both LLMs and GANs rely on immense amount of computational power, and require truly staggering amounts of data to create (or "train") in the first place. Whereas humans can learn to write and talk from a relatively small number of examples, LLMs are often trained on huge parts of the entire accessible Internet; far more than a human could ever reasonably read. As a result, data that can be used to train LLMs &mdash; that is to say, examples of human-written text &mdash; have become incredibly valuable. Sites like Reddit and Stack Overflow have made much of their recent revenue by selling user posts as training data, while many pieces of software you might use on a day-to-day basis can siphon off your data for training new LLMs.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Please don't open stuff in Microsoft Word</h1>
    <p>
      In some recent versions of Microsoft Office, Word includes copilots by default. Your terms of service with Microsoft not only allow for this, but may allow Microsoft to use documents that you open to train new versions of AI chatbots, autocompletion engines, and copilots. If it's your words that you're sharing with Microsoft, and you go in knowing that's what could happen with your work, by all means &mdash; please don't let anything on this page dissuade you from doing what you want and consent to with your words. Microsoft Word is, for all the faults highlighted here, a mature product with decades of expertise behind it, and may fit your needs perfectly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem, though, is that not everyone who sends you their work may necessarily consent to having their work shared with Microsoft in the same way. Your agreement with Microsoft is indifferent as to whether the documents you open with Word are your own or someone else's. Even opening a draft to provide comments may promise rights to that draft over to Microsoft, depending on where you live, what version of Word you're using, and what you've agreed to. For some people who might share their work with you, that's at most an annoying detail; for others, that might be a hurtful breach of the trust they've placed in you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology shouldn't work that way. Just opening a document in your favorite text processor shouldn't be the kind of thing that can get your friends and colleagues hurt. Sadly, that is the case for the monopoly-driven world of tech in general and word processing software in particular. Navigating that is harder than it should be, and places an unfair burden both on the people writing work that they'd like to share with you, and on you in reading that work. It really sucks, and there's no getting around that right now. But being thoughtful and caring with how you approach the complexity of sharing and communicating with others in a monopoly-driven world of tech is worth the extra effort, the empathy, and the love that you put into it.
    </p>

    <h1>Please don't open stuff in Google Docs</h1>
    <p>
      While Google Docs doesn't currently demand the same level of ownership over work that you open in Docs, they do claim AI training rights over any documents that you make <em>public</em>. It's easy to accidentally make a document in Google Docs public, making it more difficult to respect the trust placed in you by your friends, loved ones, collaborators, and respected enemies.
    </p>

    <h1>Some helpful alternatives</h1>
    <p>
      This is where this page gets particularly bleak: there are alternatives to Microsoft Word and Google Docs that can help you respect the trust and love that has been placed in your care, but there's not as many as would be nice, and they all come with tradeoffs that can make your life more difficult.
    </p>

    <p>
      Primary amongst those alternatives is <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, a free and open-source suite of office applications that works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Unlike Word and Google Docs, LibreOffice does not claim ownership over the documents that you open.

    <h1>What you can do to make things easier for everyone</h1>
    <p>
      We got to this state of affairs because Word is an effective monopoly in the word processing space. Everything must be compatible with Word, must open nicely in Word, format correctly in Word, use fonts that ship by default with Word, and so forth. Word has an incredibly out-sized influence over how we communicate and share our work with others.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a result, being intentional about how you reinforce or oppose that monopoly is important, and can help make it easier for everyone to choose something other than Word.
    </p>

    <h2>*.docx vs *.odt</h2>
    <p>
      The easiest step that you can take is to consider using formats other than Word's own *.docx format. International standards bodies have settled on a different format, known as <strong>OpenDocument</strong>, as it's easier to share, archive, and preserve OpenDocument files. Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice all understand and can interoperate with OpenDocument text files, using *.odt filenames. When saving and sharing your work, making sure to choose OpenDocument <em>even if you also provide a *.docx</em> can help reduce and oppose Microsoft's monopoly over the written word.
