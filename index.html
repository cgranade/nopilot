      When someone sends you a draft of their work, whether that's a technical writeup, a recipe for the best goddamn brownies you've ever tasted, a heartfelt and heartbreaking poem, or a fanfic of your favorite slash, they're trusting you to treat that work with love and respect. Unfortunately, modern software has made it harder and harder for us to uphold the trust, love, and respect with which people share their words with us. AI assistants and "copilots" can abuse that trust to train on and plagarize work, can suggest crude and inhuman edits, and can grant copyright permissions to giant corporations that fail to uphold that trust.

        You may see similar disclaimers offered by AI chatbots: the difference that the authors of this page care, the truth matters to them, but ultimately they're human with all the correponding limitations on expertise and knowledge that come along with that. AI chatbots do not and cannot care, and truth is simply not a goal that they are designed to achieve.

    <h1>Please don't open stuff in Microsoft Word</h1>
    <p>
      In some recent versions of Microsoft Office, Word includes copilots by default. Your terms of service with Microsoft not only allow for this, but may allow Microsoft to use documents that you open to train new versions of AI chatbots, autocompletion engines, and copilots. If it's your words that you're sharing with Microsoft, and you go in knowing that's what could happen with your work, by all means &mdash; please don't let anything on this page dissuade you from doing what you want and consent to with your words. Microsoft Word is, for all the faults highlighted here, a mature product with decades of expertise behind it, and may fit your needs perfectly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem, though, is that not everyone who sends you their work may necessarily consent to having their work shared with Microsoft in the same way. Your agreement with Microsoft is indifferent as to whether the documents you open with Word are your own or someone else's. Even opening a draft to provide comments may promise rights to that draft over to Microsoft, depending on where you live, what version of Word you're using, and what you've agreed to. For some people who might share their work with you, that's at most an annoying detail; for others, that might be a hurtful breach of the trust they've placed in you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Technology shouldn't work that way. Just opening a document in your favorite text processor shouldn't be the kind of thing that can get your friends and colleagues hurt. Sadly, that is the case for the monopoly-driven world of tech in general and word processing software in particular. Navigating that is harder than it should be, and places an unfair burden both on the people writing work that they'd like to share with you, and on you in reading that work. It really sucks, and there's no getting around that right now. But being thoughtful and caring with how you approach the complexity of sharing and communicating with others in a monopoly-driven world of tech is worth the extra effort, the empathy, and the love that you put into it.
